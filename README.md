# Webdev

Project to be completed by 21st June by Joel, David, Vic, Jonathon and Hannah

### Requirements to be presented ###

Connecting to two stacks each (hdb & rdb).
GUI will have two tabs (one for rdb and one for hdb). GUI is to at least, include the following;

RDB
a) A time series graph showing the running average price for each sym for the day (line graph, with sliding time filter)
b) Max & Min from a) (summary boxes)
c) Last Value Cache (dynamic table eg. colour change on table cell for price change (down red, up – green))
d) Volume by Sym (bar chart)
e) Highest traded Sym from d) (summary box)
f) Tree Map/Alternative visual in D3 by size, Sym

HDB
a) Sym volatility (graph) (with yesterday/week/month options & also Sym filters)
b) Most & Least traded Sym for previous week from a) (summary boxes)
c) HDB Counts for previous working week (graph)
d) Highest & lowest day from c) (summary boxes)

These will be created using the JavaScript library D3, passing in data(JSON format) using qREST (further questions on this side can be directed to Paul).

Visuals/themes/colours etc are up to the teams (there are multiple resources online show casing data visualisations and how to make them as aesthetically pleasing as possible).
Questions/Further explanation on any of the above/the project as a whole can be sent through to Engineering team/Sharon.

It's up to the team to drive progress amongst themselves and choose leaders for set periods of time, delegation of tasks etc.
After the two weeks – GUIs will be presented to Senior Management who will provide feedback.
